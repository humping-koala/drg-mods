# Glowing Ebonuts

It works by replacing the material reference of the ebonut shell models with a dummy material
that is named in the same way as the desired material in the original game. The models are then
repacked without the dummy material, effectively referencing the target material from the original pak.

- SM_Ebonut_shellBroken_0(1/2/3)
