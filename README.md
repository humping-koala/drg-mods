# Deep Rock Galactic mods

## ðŸ›  Mods
- **Glowing Ebonuts**: Replaces the texture of ebonuts with the one from Apoca Bloom that emits green light, making them significantly more noticeable.
- **Lucky Day**: Guarantees spawn of *Machine Events*, *Cargo Crates* and *Lost Loot Packs* on any map.

## ðŸ“œ Scripts
All mods are packaged via the help of powershell scripts. Each mod directory contains its own ps1 script which defines mod-specific parameters and executes [PakScript.ps1](./PakScript.ps1). The PakScript is capable of automatically determining Unreal Engine 4.25 install location as well as DRG's install location, where it saves the resulting pak file.

The script supports "paking" both UE4 project-based mods and hex-edited mods.
