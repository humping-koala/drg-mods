# ‚õè Deep Rock Galactic mods ‚õè

A collection of mods of mine that were deemed too radical for mainstream circles and consequently expelled. This repository contains both ready to use pak builds as well as source files that were used to build them.

## üõ† Installation

Download and place `.pak` file into `%DeepRockGalactic%\FSD\Content\Paks`

## üìö Mods

- ü•ú **[Glowing Ebonuts]**: Replaces the texture of ebonuts with the one from Apoca Bloom that emits green light, making them significantly more noticeable.
- üçÄ **[Lucky Day]**: Guarantees spawn of *Machine Events*, *Cargo Crates* and *Lost Loot Packs* on any map. You can also use [Show Events] mod to check the spawns.
- üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è **[Deep Rock Piracy]**: Unlocks all DLCs except the Supporter Upgrade. No idea how to unlock that one. **Use at your own risk!** Support the devs and buy the DLCs if you can.
- üü• **[Nitra Infestation]**: Spawns massive number of nitra veins all over the map.
- üö´ **[No more gold]**: Disables spawn of gold veins on the map.

## üìú Scripts
All mods are packaged via the help of powershell scripts. Each mod directory contains [its own ps1 script](./GlowingEbonuts/GlowingEbonuts.ps1) which defines mod-specific parameters and executes [PakScript.ps1](./PakScript.ps1).
The PakScript is capable of automatically determining Unreal Engine 4.25 install location as well as DRG's install location (Steam edition), where it saves the resulting pak file.
The script supports paking both UE4 project-based mods and hex-edited mods. In case of UE4 project-based mods, it will cook the game content first, before packaging it.
